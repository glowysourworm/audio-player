Goals:  

	Cross Platform - Use Avalonia UI to target Windows / Linux
	
	Understand Audio Library - Use web services to complete tag data for audio files
	
	Complete Album Artwork - Gather image files into a custom file-based database for the
							 audio player. Use database to de-populate / re-populate album
							 artwork files.
							 
	Audio Player Database - Simple file-based database to organize audio files; and to be
							able to re-populate a file tree based on some new orginization. This
							includes album artwork.
							
							Also, complete tag / artwork data using web services to locate
							missing information.
							
UI Layout:

	Library Manager - Several lists of information by relevant tag. Statistics about which files
					  have missing data, missing artwork, etc..
					  
					  Functions to work with populating some of the missing data using web services.
					  
					  Functions to de-populate / re-populate audio library files from database.
					  
	Now Playing - Simple music-bee (or) banshee like display to select songs to play / populate a playlist.
